# SMOTE-Analysis-for-Imbalanced-Datasets

The given project is to predict the classification score for the triplets in the given dataset with highly imbalanced dataset. The project is developed to use SMOTE (Synthetic Minority Oversampling Technique) to deal with the current problem and to improve the precision and the recall score of the model which would be worst if the data is imbalanced with current values as:
(0:262905), 
(1:558)
